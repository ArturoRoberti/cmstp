# Disclaimer - Use at your own risk
This project is currently (12.2025) coded solely by me. As a junior developer, there is probably a lot that can be improved and although I have tested each task, there may be some unforeseen issues. Please use with caution and report any issues you find (see the [contributing](#contributing) section).

During this project's initial development, I recommend using it solely on fresh machines.

# Installation and Usage
